		From New York City, East Harlem had the higher incidence of psychiatric hospitalizations by <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/data/2015chp-mn11.pdf">2015</a>. This borought of Manhattan has <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/dc/east-harlem-resource-guide.pdf">seven facilities for mental health</a>. However, a <a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-022-04112-w">study</a> released in 2022 focused on the mental health situation of uninsured patients at East Harlem, also known as Spanish Harlem. This study revealed that, from all the patients treated at the East Harlem Health Outreach Partnership (EHHOP) clinic during the study, 97% were hispanic. According to the authors of the study, free mental health clinics dedicated to this community are particularly important because many immigrants do not meet the requirements to get insurance. The study also identified that 68% of the uninsured population receiving services at the clinic were women. </p>

			The most common diagnosis given at the clinic was depression. The study divides depression, major depressive desorder and other types of depression. For the purpose of this article, we are going to focus on the general type of depression and other four different diagnosis which were: multiple psychiatric disorders, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and alcohol use disorder.
